    'Delegating is a feature of Avalanche’s staking mechanism that allows token holders to participate in securing a network by adding their tokens to an existing validator to stake. When delegating, the token holder remains in control at all times of its tokens and keys but locks up the value of its tokens. In exchange for locking up the value of its tokens, the token holder receives a share of the staking rewards received by the validator based on its delegation amount, less a fee retained by the validator called a Delegation Fee.',
  disclaimerTextItem2:
    'When selecting a validator, it is important to consider factors, such as uptime, staking period and others, in addition to the Delegation Fee. Please conduct your own research before delegating. To learn more about delegating, click here.',

    'Stake allows users to participate in securing the Avalanche blockchain by delegating their tokens to validators while at all times remaining in control of their tokens and their keys.
