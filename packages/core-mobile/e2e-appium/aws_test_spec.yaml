android_test_host: amazon_linux_2

# Phases represent collections of commands that are executed during your test run on the test host.
phases:

  # The install phase contains commands for installing dependencies to run your tests.
  # For your convenience, certain dependencies are preinstalled on the test host. To learn about which
  # software is included with the host, and how to install additional software, please see:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/amazon-linux-2-supported-software.html

  # Many software libraries you may need are available from the test host using the devicefarm-cli tool.
  # To learn more about what software is available from it and how to use it, please see:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/amazon-linux-2-devicefarm-cli.html

      # The Appium server is written using Node.js. In order to run your desired version of Appium,
      # you first need to set up a Node.js environment that is compatible with your version of Appium.
      # Our tests require Node.js 20.19.0 or higher as specified in package.json
      - devicefarm-cli use node 20
      - node --version

      # Use the devicefarm-cli to select a preinstalled major version of Appium.
      - devicefarm-cli use appium 2
      - appium --version

      # The Device Farm service automatically updates the preinstalled Appium versions over time to
      # incorporate the latest minor and patch versions for each major version. If you wish to
      # select a specific version of Appium, you can use NPM to install it.
      # - npm install -g appium@2.1.3

      # For Appium version 2, Device Farm automatically updates the preinstalled UIAutomator2 driver
      # over time to incorporate the latest minor and patch versions for its major version 2. If you
      # want to install a specific version of the driver, you can use the Appium extension CLI to
      # uninstall the existing UIAutomator2 driver and install your desired version:
      # - appium driver uninstall uiautomator2
      # - appium driver install uiautomator2@2.34.0

  pre_test:
    commands:
      # Appium downloads Chromedriver using a feature that is considered insecure for multitenant
      # environments. This is not a problem for Device Farm because each test host is allocated
      # exclusively for one customer, then terminated entirely. For more information, please see
      # https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/packages/appium/docs/en/guides/security.md

      # We recommend starting the Appium server process in the background using the command below.
      # The Appium server log will be written to the $DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR directory.
      # The environment variables passed as capabilities to the server will be automatically assigned
      # during your test run based on your test's specific device.
      # For more information about which environment variables are set and how they're set, please see
