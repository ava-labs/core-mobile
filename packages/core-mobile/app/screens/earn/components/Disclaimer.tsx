When delegating, the token holder remains in control at all times of its tokens and keys but locks up the value of its tokens. In exchange for locking up the value of its tokens, the token holder receives a share of the staking rewards received by the validator based on its delegation amount, less a fee retained by the validator called a Delegation Fee.'
